A copy of the DCO text can be found at https://developercertificate.org/\n\n\nMost importantly: To make it easy to read and understand the code. Remember: you may be the only one writing the code initially, but many people will need to read, understand, modify, and fix the code over its lifetime. These conventions attempt to make this task much easier. If the code consistently follows these standards, it improves developer understanding across the entire source base.\nTo make it easy to debug the code, with both a system call tracer and GNU debuggers. It should be easy to set breakpoints, view locals, and display and view data structures.\nTo attempt to improve code quality through consistency, and requiring patterns that are less likely to result in bugs either initially, or after code modification.\n\n\nEach feature should come with a rich set of test cases that can be executed as unit tests during build. If the feature is more invasive or richer, you need more and richer test cases. Refer to other test cases in /tests directory, which use either GTest or SSAT.\nWhen new test cases are introduced, the number of new negative test cases should be larger than or equal to the number of new positive test cases.\nFor C-code, try to stick with C89.\nFor C++-code, try to be compatible with C++14. C++ code should be able to be built optionally. In other words, by disabling C++ build option, we should be able to build the whole system without C++ compilers.\nAvoid introducing additional dependencies of libraries. If you are going to use additional libraries, your codes may be located at /ext/* so that they can be \"optional\" features.\nIf your functions or structs/classes are going to be accessed by other modules or NNStreamer users, provide full descriptions of all entries with Doxygen.\nPassing all the tests of TAOS-CI is a necessary condition, but not a satisfying condition.\n\n\nIt has passed all the tests defined for TAOS-CI.\n\nThis includes unit tests and integration tests in various platforms and different static analysis tools.\nNote that one of the tests includes the \"Signed-off-by\" check, which means that the author has agreed with Code of Conduct. You may need to refer to later section.\n\n\nAt least TWO committers (reviewers with voting rights) have approved the PR.\n\nThis is a necessary condition, not sufficient.\nIf the PR touches sensitive codes or may affect wide ranges of components, reviewers will wait for other reviewers to back them up.\nIf the PR is messy, you will need to wait indefinitely to get reviews.\n\nApply general rules of git commits and common senses.\nDo not write a lengthy commit. Apply a single commit per PR if you are new to the community. Have a single topic per commit. Provide enough background information and references. And so on.\n\n\n\n\nThere is no rejections from any official reviewers.\nThere is no pending negative feedbacks (unresolved issues) from reviewers.\nA committer with merging privilege will, then, be able to merge the given PR.\n\n\nThis includes unit tests and integration tests in various platforms and different static analysis tools.\nNote that one of the tests includes the \"Signed-off-by\" check, which means that the author has agreed with Code of Conduct.
